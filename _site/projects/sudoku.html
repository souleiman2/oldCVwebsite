    <p><a href="https://github.com/souleiman2/Sudoku-Generator">Code</a></p>

<p>This is a sudoku generator (not playable but it gives you the solution and the grid with numbers that are deleted).
I will be creating a playable version soon.</p>

<p>1  2  3<br />
4  5  6<br />
7  8  9</p>

<p>-&gt; If you don‚Äôt feel like reading the code this is what is happening (I will refer to the 3x3 squares by numbers in the same order of the 
square numbers above):</p>

<p>Create the cross :</p>

<p>1) Randomly fill the squares 2 and 4</p>

<p>2) Create the squares 6 and 8 such as they work with the squares 2 and 4</p>

<p>3) Create the square 5 thanks to these 4 squares (if their is a problem such as entanglement switch the position of 2 numbers 
  (one of them is the one that is creating the problem) of 2 matrix that are opposite -&gt; (2 and 8) or (4 and 6))</p>

<p><br />

<br /></p>

<p>Create the corners:</p>

<p>1) Create the squares 1, 3 and 7 thanks to the dependancies (the other squares that are in their lane)7</p>

<p>2) Create the last square
  -&gt; If it doesn‚Äôt work fix by switching only horizontally numbers if the matrix is vertical to the square and 
vertically if the matrix is horizontal to the matrix (look at a picture called switching and yes the numbers 2 and 5 must be on the same 
column so you make sure not to destroy the rest of the sudoku)</p>

<p><br />

<br /></p>

<p>-&gt; if the numbers that are creating the problem cannot be switch adequatly -&gt; restart the generation (since it‚Äôs fast it‚Äôs not much of an
  issue)</p>

<p>And there you go you have a sudoku generator üòÉ</p>
